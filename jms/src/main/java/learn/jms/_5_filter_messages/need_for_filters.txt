                    Queue
                    ---->           Consumer App 1
Sender App          ---->           Consumer App 2
                    ---->           Consumer App 3

What if consumer apps want to consume messages on a conditional basis?
If the logic is built into each consumer, then it can only find that the message does not have certain property
    only once the message is received from the queue
But by that time, message would be removed from the queue and other consumers won't even receive that message!
This is a weird situation!

Therefore with filters, a consumer can ask JMS provider to only send the messages that have certain properties.
It is the responsibility of sender to attach the properties so each message can be checked.

Filters are like SQL queries, and can be only applied on message properties and certain headers
Headers:    1. JMSDeliveryMode
            2. JMSPriority
            3. JMSMessageID
            4. JMSCorrelationID
            5. JMSType
