There are 2 types of caches

1. First level cache
        This is only works during a single transaction and ACTIVE by default
        Within that transaction, if same query is fired again times, then hibernate will not generate 2 different calls,
            it will retrieve the data from its cache

2. Second level cache
        This will work throughout the application. i.e., common for all transactions within the application
        If 2 same queries are fired by 2 different transactions, then data is retrieved from 2nd level cache
        But we have to configure this -> EhCache
